# Embracing Cornish Culture and Legacy

I am passionately committed to championing and safeguarding Cornish culture and identity, intricately weaving it into the vibrant tapestry of St Ives' community.

**Preserving Tradition and Cultivating Artistic Spaces**

As a Cornish bard, I wholeheartedly dedicate myself to preserving our rich heritage and language, validated by my proficiency in Cornish proven through Kesva exams. I proudly deliver proclamations in Cornish at local events, infusing fresh vitality into a timeless tradition.

**Guardian of Tradition and Town Ceremonies**

In my role as a Town Mace Bearer, I stand as a guardian of our local traditions, upholding the customs that define St Ives. With the weight of responsibility and history on my shoulders, I carry the mace with pride and honour during town ceremonies, symbolising our enduring legacy.

**Steward of Artistic Spaces**

Expanding my sphere of responsibility, I am a dedicated steward of Porthmeor Studios, preserving their role as both a sanctuary for artistic expression and a vital repository of St. Ives' rich fishing heritage.Additionally, I provide essential support at the Town Guild Hall. These spaces serve as the very canvas on which our profound cultural narratives are painted.

These roles converge in my mission to embrace, protect, and celebrate Cornish culture and identity, creating a richer, more vibrant St Ives for all.
