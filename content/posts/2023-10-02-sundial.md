# The Sundial's Wisdom: Embracing Impermanence in a Changing World

## Introduction

In the quiet corner of St. Ia's Church, nestled amidst the picturesque beauty of its surroundings, a mysterious sundial stands as a sentinel of time. Its Latin inscription, though weathered and faded, carries timeless wisdom that resonates with us even today. In this blog post, we'll explore the translation of the sundial's inscription and consider how its message can impact our lives in a world that is constantly evolving.


## The Sundial's Latin Inscription

The sundial's Latin inscription reads:


> TRANSI [UNT OMNES MORIBUNDI]  
SIC TRANSIT GLORIA MUNDI.  
AND: CURNOW TOWEDNACK. 1739.





### Translation

>All who are dying pass away.  
Thus passes the glory of the world.  
Curnow Towednack. 1739 AD

## Understanding the Message

1. **Embracing Impermanence**: The sundial's message reminds us of the impermanence of life and worldly achievements. "All who are dying pass away" speaks to the inevitability of mortality. It encourages us to accept that life, like the passing hours on the sundial, is transient.

2. **The Fleeting Nature of Glory**: "Thus passes the glory of the world" highlights the fleeting nature of material success and fame. It urges us to recognize that the pursuit of material wealth and recognition, while important in their own right, should not be our sole focus.

## How Does This Apply to Our Lives Today?

In our fast-paced and ever-changing world, the wisdom of the sundial can provide valuable insights:

1. **Mindful Living**: Embracing the impermanence of life can lead to a more mindful and meaningful existence. We should cherish each moment, appreciate our loved ones, and pursue our passions with purpose.

2. **Prioritizing Values**: The sundial encourages us to prioritize values and experiences that bring lasting fulfillment, such as love, kindness, and personal growth. While material success is valuable, it should not overshadow these deeper aspects of life.

3. **Coping with Change**: In a world where change is constant, understanding the ephemeral nature of worldly glories can help us navigate transitions and challenges with grace. We learn to adapt, evolve, and find strength in resilience.

4. **Legacy Building**: Rather than obsessing over personal glory, we can focus on leaving a meaningful legacy through our actions, contributions, and the positive impact we have on others.

## Conclusion

St. Ia's Church's ancient sundial, with its cryptic Latin inscription, speaks volumes about the human experience. It serves as a timeless reminder that life is a fleeting journey, and material wealth and fame are but passing glories. By embracing impermanence and prioritizing meaningful values, we can lead more fulfilling lives, navigate change with resilience, and leave behind a lasting legacy that transcends the boundaries of time. As we gaze upon this humble timekeeper, let us reflect on the wisdom it imparts and strive for a life well-lived, one that transcends the limitations of the world's fleeting pomp.
