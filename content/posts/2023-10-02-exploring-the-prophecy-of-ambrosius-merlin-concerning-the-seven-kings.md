The world of Arthurian legends is filled with mystical tales, heroic deeds, and prophecies that have captivated generations of readers and scholars. One such intriguing work is "The Prophecy of Ambrosius Merlin concerning the Seven Kings," a poem attributed to the legendary figure Merlin, known as Myrddin in Welsh mythology. This poem, found in the "Black Book of Carmarthen," offers a glimpse into the history and future of Britain, all through the lens of seven influential kings. 

## The Seven Kings

The poem is divided into seven sections, each corresponding to one of the seven kings who are said to be descendants of King Arthur and bearers of his name. These kings are:

1. **Uther Pendragon**: The father of King Arthur and a son of Constantine III.
2. **Arthur**: The most famous king of Britain and the leader of the Round Table.
3. **Cadwaladr**: The king of Gwynedd (Wales) and a leader of the Britons against the Anglo-Saxons.
4. **Conan**: The king or prince of Brittany or Cornwall and a relative of King Arthur.
5. **Edward I**: The king of England and lord of Ireland, known for conquering Wales and Scotland.
6. **Richard II**: The king of England, who became a prisoner and martyr during his reign.
7. **Henry V**: The king of England celebrated for his role in the Hundred Yearsâ€™ War.

## The Author and His Notes

The poem is attributed to John of Cornwall, a 12th-century scholar and writer. John claimed to have translated or revived the poem from a lost manuscript in the Cornish language. He wrote the poem in Latin hexameters but included some marginal notes in Cornish to clarify certain words and phrases. These notes not only help in understanding the text but also provide valuable insights into the linguistic and cultural context of the time.
