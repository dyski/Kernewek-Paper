# Thomas Tonkin and the Cornish Language Revival

Thomas Tonkin (1678-1742), a Cornish landowner and historian, had a significant role in documenting and promoting the Cornish language during the early 18th century. Here's a breakdown of his contributions:

## 1. **Proficiency in Cornish and Welsh Languages**:
   - Tonkin made 'great proficiency in studying the Welsh and Cornish languages' around the period from 1700 onwards, which laid a solid foundation for his subsequent contributions to the Cornish language revival ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tonkin)).

## 2. **Collaboration in Language Documentation**:
   - Thomas Tonkin collaborated with William Gwavas in producing a wordlist, which is preserved in Tonkinâ€™s archive of manuscript materials on Cornish, now housed in Bilbao ([Academic](https://academic.oup.com)).

## 3. **Abridgement of Cornish Treatise**:
   - He abridged a treatise, 'Antiquities Cornu-Britannick', which was later printed in 1777 and incorporated in Davies Gilbert's history at the end of his history. This work was a step towards documenting and preserving Cornish linguistic heritage ([Wikisource](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:A_handbook_of_the_Cornish_language;_Chiefly_in_its_latest_stages_...)).

## 4. **Assistance in Cornish Grammar and Vocabulary Compilation**:
   - Tonkin, alongside Gwavas, provided considerable assistance to Edward Lhuyd, who was working on Cornish Grammar. They compiled a vocabulary and collection of Cornish fragments titled 'Archaeologia Cornu-Britannica', which was later printed by Dr. William Pryce in 1790 ([Wikisource](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:A_handbook_of_the_Cornish_language;_Chiefly_in_its_latest_stages_...)).

## 5. **Engagement in Cornish Language Preservation Initiatives**:
   - Tonkin was part of a group of Cornishmen who invited Edward Lhuyd to Cornwall in 1700 with the aim of helping preserve the language, showcasing their awareness and proactive approach towards preventing the language's extinction ([Cornwall Heritage](https://www.cornwallheritage.com)).

## 6. **Proposed Printing of Cornish Linguistic Material**:
   - In 1736, Tonkin drafted a collection of modern Cornish pieces and a Cornish vocabulary for printing, as well as proposed the printing of a history of Cornwall in 1737. Though these works were not published during his lifetime, they indicated his dedication to documenting and promoting Cornish language and history ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tonkin)).

Through his linguistic proficiency, collaborative efforts, and initiatives, Thomas Tonkin played a pivotal role in documenting the Cornish language, thus contributing significantly to the groundwork for its revival.
