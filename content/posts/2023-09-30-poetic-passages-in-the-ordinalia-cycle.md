The Ordinalia cycle, while not considered spectacular as a whole, contains certain passages of exceptional poetry. In fact, it is suggested that a Cornish poem may have been borrowed by the author of "The Passion of Christ" and incorporated into the play. Let's delve into this fascinating aspect of Middle Cornish literature.

## The Mater Dolorosa's Poem

According to Nance, a Cornish scholar, it is within the context of the Passion Play that a shorter religious poem can be found. This poem features the Mater Dolorosa, and in Middle Cornish, it is a beautiful piece of verse that could be described in the English of its time as 'grete laymentacyoun.' Despite being fragmented and distributed across three separate scenes of the play, none of its essence appears to be lost. Its distinctive metrical arrangement makes it relatively easy to reassemble, forming two verses, each comprising twenty-five lines.

### A Glimpse of the Poem

Here is the poem, as restored by Nance in Unified Cornish, offering a clear indication of the poetic value embedded in the Ordinalia cycle:

| Gans paynys mur                   | with great sufferings                                      |
| Ow dyswul glan!                   | to destroy me utterly!                                     |

|                                   |                                                            |
| Govy, ny-won pandr 'a wraf        | Woe is me, I know not what I shall do!                     |

| Ny-allaf sevel yn-fas             | hardly can I stand                                         |
| War ow threys, ellas, ellas,      | upon my feet. Alas,                                        |
