The Ordinalia cycle, while not considered spectacular as a whole, contains certain passages of exceptional poetry. In fact, it is suggested that a Cornish poem may have been borrowed by the author of "The Passion of Christ" and incorporated into the play. Let's delve into this fascinating aspect of Middle Cornish literature.

## The Mater Dolorosa's Poem

According to Nance, a Cornish scholar, it is within the context of the Passion Play that a shorter religious poem can be found. This poem features the Mater Dolorosa, and in Middle Cornish, it is a beautiful piece of verse that could be described in the English of its time as 'grete laymentacyoun.' Despite being fragmented and distributed across three separate scenes of the play, none of its essence appears to be lost. Its distinctive metrical arrangement makes it relatively easy to reassemble, forming two verses, each comprising twenty-five lines.

### A Glimpse of the Poem

Here is the poem, as restored by Nance in Unified Cornish, offering a clear indication of the poetic value embedded in the Ordinalia cycle:

I  
Ellas! A gryst, ow map ker,  
Yn mur bayn pan y-th-whelaf,  
Ellas! dre guth pan yn clamder  
Dhe'n dor prag na omwhelaf?  
Dre ow map pyth yu ow cher?  
Pup ur-oll y-n-benygaf!  
Ellas! ny-won py tyller,  
Byth moy py le, y-trygaf,

Ogh, govy, ellas, ellas,

Gans tebel wesyon dyghtys!  
A vap, dha guth re-m-ladhas,  
Na allaf gweles yn-fas Â·  
Kemmys dagrow re-olys!  
Govy, ny-won pandr 'a wraf  
Gallas ow holon pur glaf  
Dre brederow!  
Ny-allaf sevel yn-fas

Rak Galarow!  

Verse 1
Alas, O Christ, my dear son, 
when in great suffering I see Thee,
Alas, for grief, why do I not fall in a swoon? 
Through my Son, what is my state?

All the time I bless Him!

Alas, I know not on what spot, 
nor yet in what place I shall abide,
O, woe,  
for it is wished,  
if possible, with great sufferings to destroy me utterly!
O woe is me!  Alas! Alas, to see my Son so shamefully used by wicked fellows!
O Son, Thy sorrow hath slain me, so that I can scarce see, so many tears have I shed!
Woe is me, I know not what I shall do!
My heart has become right sick through care: hardly can I stand upon my feet.
Alas, for my sorrow.

Verse 2  
Alas! Alas! O, sad, sad! 
What care is in my heart
when I see my Son, Jesu, 
with a crown of thorns about His head,
and He the Son of God, of Power, 
and therewithal a rightful King! 
Feet and hands nailed fast on either side with spikes of iron. 
Alas! On the Day of Doom shalt thou have much misery
who didst sell Him, 
both flesh and fell! 
O woe is me, for my
dear Son, to see Him treated in the same way which now I see!
Alas, that I might not also die, 
that my end might not sooner
be on earth than the end of my Son! 
Well may I be sorrowful
to see my Son so ungently treated as He is; He who is the lord
in grace abounding! 
Woe is me forever! Alas! Alas! 
for Thee, Jhesu!                       |
