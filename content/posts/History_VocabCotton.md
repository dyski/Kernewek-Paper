# **Introduction:**
Old Cornish, is an ancient Celtic language that was spoken in Cornwall over a thousand years ago. In this learning material, we will explore *Old Cornish* and its most famous document, the *Cottonian Vocabulary*.

# **Section 1: Old Cornish and Its Evolution**

## **1.1 Historical Context:** 
   - Old Cornish and Welsh were once very similar languages.
   - Over time, they grew apart due to geographical separation and influence from other languages.
   - During the early Norman period (around the 12th century), Old Cornish and Welsh (especially Southern Welsh) were so alike that they were often mistaken for each other.

# **Section 2: The Cottonian Vocabulary**

## **2.1 What is the Cottonian Vocabulary?**
   - The Cottonian Vocabulary, also known as the Vocabularium Comicum or Old Cornish Vocabulary, is a list of Old Cornish words with their Latin translations.
   - It covers a wide range of topics, including body parts, animals, plants, church terms, and more.
   - The document even includes a Cornish calendar and information about Cornish and Welsh saints.

## **2.2 Historical Significance:**
   - The Cottonian Vocabulary is one of the oldest surviving pieces of Old Cornish from the 12th century.
   - Initially, it was mistaken for a Welsh vocabulary because of the words "Vocabularium Wallicum" (Welsh vocabulary) written at the end.

## **2.3 Rediscovery:**
   - Mr. John Antis discovered the Cottonian Vocabulary in the Cottonian Library during the early 1700s.
   - He questioned its classification and sought the expertise of Edward Lhuyd, a well-known Celtic scholar.

## **2.4 Edward Lhuyd's Confirmation:**
   - Edward Lhuyd recognized that the document was, in fact, Old Cornish and not Welsh.
   - He stated, "When I had seen the book, I knew very well that it was not a Welsh vocabulary... but a Cornish vocabulary."

# **Section 3: Importance of the Cottonian Vocabulary**

## **3.1 Linguistic Significance:**
   - The manuscript is an invaluable resource for studying Old Cornish.
   - It is one of the earliest and longest texts in the language, shedding light on its development over time.

## **3.2 Insights into Culture and Religion:**
   - The Cottonian Vocabulary provides insights into the culture and religion of Medieval Cornwall through its descriptions of saints and religious terms.

## **3.3 Preservation and Research:**
   - This document is crucial for preserving the history of the Cornish language as it is one of the few sources of Old Cornish.
   - Scholars like Edward Lhuyd studied it extensively to better understand the language and its evolution.

# **Conclusion:**
The Cottonian Vocabulary offers a window into the world of Old Cornish, a language that once thrived in Cornwall. Its rediscovery and recognition by Mr. John Antis and Edward Lhuyd have been pivotal in understanding the linguistic and cultural heritage of this ancient Celtic language. Studying the Cottonian Vocabulary helps us appreciate the rich history of Cornwall and the importance of preserving linguistic diversity.
