Cornish is a South-Western British Celtic language, closely related to Breton and Welsh. In the period between 600 and 800 AD, the westward movement of Anglo-Saxon peoples separated the Celts of Strathclyde, Cumbria, Wales, and the Cornish peninsula. The dialects of Common British developed into Primitive Welsh, Primitive Cornish, and Primitive Breton, the earliest stages of separate languages spoken in Wales, Cornwall, and Brittany, respectively. The further history of Cornish is conventionally divided into Old Cornish (from its beginnings to the end of the twelfth century), Middle Cornish (1200-1600), and Late Cornish (1600-1800). The last phase is also known as Traditional Cornish, in contrast to Modern Cornish, the result of various contemporary attempts at reviving the language.

**Old Cornish and Early Evidence:**
The earliest evidence for Old Cornish consists of nineteen glosses from the end of the ninth century and three glosses from the tenth century. The largest piece of Old Cornish is a Latin-Cornish glossary, known as the Vocabularium Cornicum or the Cottonian Vocabulary, dating from around 1100 AD and containing 961 words. This glossary includes words related to various aspects of life.

**Middle Cornish and Literature:**
The main bulk of Cornish literature is associated with the Middle Cornish period. During this time, Cornish literature was primarily religious verse and mystery plays. "Pascon agan Arluth" ("The Passion of Our Lord") is a significant religious poem composed circa 1375. Another important piece of Cornish literature is "An Ordinalia Kernewek" ("The Cornish Ordinalia"), a religious drama in three parts.

**Late Cornish and Decline:**
Late Cornish literature includes "Gwreans an Bys" ("The Creacion of the World"), written down in 1611, and "Daralla Jooan Choye a Horr" ("The Tale of John Ramshouse"), a short folk-tale. The decline of Cornish as a spoken language can be attributed to factors such as illiteracy in Cornish, lack of Cornish-language education, and the preference for English.

**Revival and Modern Cornish:**
Interest in Cornish language and culture experienced a revival in the late nineteenth century, with figures like Henry Jenner contributing to its revitalization. Unified Cornish, based on Middle Cornish, became the standard for the revival. However, there have been ongoing debates and controversies regarding its phonology, vocabulary, and grammar. In 1987, a new system called Kernewek Kemmyn (Common Cornish) was officially recommended by the Cornish Language Board. More recently, the Teere ha Tavaz (‘Land and Language’) movement seeks to return to the vernacular form of Modern Cornish.

**Contemporary Literature:**
Contemporary Cornish literature is written in Unified Cornish, Common Cornish, and Modern Cornish. It includes poetry, short stories, children's books, translations, and even radio plays. Despite its growth, publishing in Cornish remains limited, with challenges such as multiple spelling systems and the need for standardization.

In conclusion, Cornish language and literature have experienced a revival in recent years, with efforts to preserve and promote this unique Celtic language. However, challenges persist, including issues related to standardization and a limited audience for Cornish literature.
