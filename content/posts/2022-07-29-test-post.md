**Learning Materials: Understanding Old Cornish (Medieval Cornish) and the Cottonian Vocabulary**

**Introduction:**
Old Cornish, (Medieval Cornish), is an ancient Celtic language that was spoken in Cornwall over a thousand years ago. In this learning material, we will explore *Old Cornish* and its most famous document, the *Cottonian Vocabulary*.

**Section 1: Old Cornish and Its Evolution**

**1.1 Historical Context:** 
   - Old Cornish and Welsh were once very similar languages.
   - Over time, they grew apart due to geographical separation and influence from other languages.
   - During the early Norman period (around the 12th century), Old Cornish and Welsh (especially Southern Welsh) were so alike that they were often mistaken for each other.

**Section 2: The Cottonian Vocabulary**

**2.1 What is the Cottonian Vocabulary?**
   - The Cottonian Vocabulary, also known as the Vocabularium Comicum or Old Cornish Vocabulary, is a list of Old Cornish words with their Latin translations.
   - It covers a wide range of topics, including body parts, animals, plants, church terms, and more.
   - The document even includes a Cornish calendar and information about Cornish and Welsh saints.

**2.2 Historical Significance:**
   - The Cottonian Vocabulary is one of the oldest surviving pieces of Old Cornish from the 12th century.
   - Initially, it was mistaken for a Welsh vocabulary because of the words "Vocabularium Wallicum" (Welsh vocabulary) written at the end.

**2.3 Rediscovery:**
   - Mr. John Antis discovered the Cottonian Vocabulary in the Cottonian Library during the early 1700s.
   - He questioned its classification and sought the expertise of Edward Lhuyd, a well-known Celtic scholar.

**2.4 Edward Lhuyd's Confirmation:**
   - Edward Lhuyd recognized that the document was, in fact, Old Cornish and not Welsh.
   - He stated, "When I had seen the book, I knew very well that it was not a Welsh vocabulary... but a Cornish vocabulary."

**Section 3: Importance of the Cottonian Vocabulary**

**3.1 Linguistic Significance:**
   - The manuscript is an invaluable resource for studying Old Cornish.
   - It is one of the earliest and longest texts in the language, shedding light on its development over time.

**3.2 Insights into Culture and Religion:**
   - The Cottonian Vocabulary provides insights into the culture and religion of Medieval Cornwall through its descriptions of saints and religious terms.

**3.3 Preservation and Research:**
   - This document is crucial for preserving the history of the Cornish language as it is one of the few sources of Old Cornish.
   - Scholars like Edward Lhuyd studied it extensively to better understand the language and its evolution.

**Conclusion:**
The Cottonian Vocabulary offers a window into the world of Old Cornish, a language that once thrived in Cornwall. Its rediscovery and recognition by Mr. John Antis and Edward Lhuyd have been pivotal in understanding the linguistic and cultural heritage of this ancient Celtic language. Studying the Cottonian Vocabulary helps us appreciate the rich history of Cornwall and the importance of preserving linguistic diversity.

OLD CORNISH 
(Medieval Cornish)
A long time ago, about a thousand years ago, Cornish and Welsh were much more alike. As time went on, they grew apart because they were separated from each other and influenced by other languages.
In fact, in the early Norman period, Cornish and Welsh were so similar that a list of words, known as the 'Cottonian Vocabulary’ was initially mistaken for Welsh.
THE OLD CORNISH VOCABULARY 
(aka Vocabularium Comicum, Cottonian Vocabulary)
The 'Vocabularium Comicum,' is essentially a list of Cornish words with their Latin translations. It covers various topics like body parts, animals, plants, church terms, and more. It even includes a Cornish calendar and provides some information about Cornish and Welsh saints.
This 'Cottonian Vocabulary,' now housed in the British Museum, is incredibly important because it's one of the oldest surviving pieces of Old Cornish from the twelfth century. 
Interestingly, this manuscript wasn't recognized as Cornish for a long time. It was originally thought to be a Welsh vocabulary because it had the words 'Vocabularium Wallicum' (Welsh vocabulary) written at the end. It wasn't until the early 1700s when a man named Mr. John Antis discovered it in the Cottonian Library that its true nature came to light. He questioned the classification and reached out to Edward Lhuyd, a well-known Celtic scholar. Lhuyd quickly realised that it was, in fact, Cornish and said…
 'When I had seen the book I knew very well that it was not a Welsh vocabulary as it appeared by the Latin title 'Vocabularium Wallicum' written at the end of it, but a Cornish vocabulary.'
This manuscript is a valuable resource for anyone studying Cornish because it's one of the earliest and longest texts in the language. It helps us understand how Cornish changed over time and how it's related to other Celtic languages. It also provides insights into the culture and religion of medieval Cornwall."




Notes
- The 'Cottonian Vocabulary' is a 12th-century manuscript with Cornish words and Latin translations 
- It was based on an earlier work by Aelfric, the 'English-Latin Lexicon' 
- It was wrongly labelled as a Welsh vocabulary until Mr Antis found it in the Cottonian Library and showed it to Edward Lhuyd, a Celtic scholar
- Lhuyd confirmed that it was a Cornish vocabulary and studied it from 1701 to 1707
- The manuscript has seven pages of Cornish nouns related to various topics, such as the human body, nature, religion, etc.
- It also has a calendar with Cornish words and the lives of Cornish and Welsh saints
- This manuscript is very important for the history of the Cornish language as it is almost the only source of 'Old Cornish'.



The Cottonian Library was a huge collection of books and manuscripts that belonged to Sir Robert Cotton, a famous book lover. He had many rare and ancient texts that he saved from being lost or destroyed. His library was one of the first to become part of the British Museum, and now it is in the British Library.
The Norman era was a period in the history of England that spanned from the Norman Conquest in 1066 to the death of King John in 1216.
