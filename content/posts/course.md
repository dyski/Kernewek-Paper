# Learn Cornish for Beginners
Welcome to the exciting journey of learning the Cornish language! Whether you have a background in language learning or are starting from scratch, this course is designed to help you become proficient in Cornish, also known as "Kernewek." Let's embark on this linguistic adventure together.

## Introduction to Cornish Language

### Overview

In this first lesson, we'll dive into the fascinating world of the Cornish language. Cornish, a Celtic language, has a rich history and a vibrant revival in recent years. We'll explore its historical significance, the reasons to learn it, and the basics of Cornish.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should:

- Understand the historical significance of Cornish.

### Brief History of Cornish

Cornish is a Celtic language native to Cornwall, a region in the southwest of England. It belongs to the same language family as Welsh and Breton. The history of Cornish dates back centuries, with records of its use stretching as far as the 9th century. However, like many minority languages, Cornish faced a decline over the years due to various historical and social factors.

### The Revival of Cornish

The 20th century witnessed a revival of interest in the Cornish language and culture. Language enthusiasts, historians, and local communities worked tirelessly to bring Cornish back from the brink of extinction. Today, Cornish enjoys a growing number of speakers and learners.

### Why Learn Cornish?

Learning Cornish offers several compelling benefits:

1. **Preserve Cultural Heritage:** By learning Cornish, you contribute to the preservation of Cornwall's unique cultural heritage.

2. **Connect with the Past:** It provides a connection to the history and traditions of Cornwall.

3. **Community Engagement:** Join a community of Cornish language enthusiasts and speakers.

4. **Cognitive Benefits:** Language learning enhances cognitive abilities, including memory and problem-solving skills.

5. **Personal Fulfillment:** Learning a new language is a rewarding and enriching experience.



## Pronunciation Guide 

Welcome to the pronunciation guide. This guide will help you understand the pronunciation and spelling of the Cornish language. Please note that words are usually stressed on the last but one syllable unless otherwise indicated.

### Letters and Sounds

- **A**: 
  - Sounds like "bat" when followed by a doubled consonant, e.g., "dannvon" (to send).
  - Similar to "father" but not as long when stressed, e.g., the first syllable of "bara" (bread).
  - Acts as a neutral vowel like in "the" (not "thee") when unstressed, e.g., the second syllable of "bara" (bread). It is never pronounced like the English "made."

- **AW**: 
  - Rhymes with "how," e.g., "glaw" (rain).

- **AY**: 
  - Rhymes with "by," e.g., "chayn" (chain).

- **B**: 
  - Usually pronounced as in English.
  - At the end of a word, it sounds like "P" unless followed by a vowel in the next word immediately without a pause. For example, "y vab" (his son) sounds as "P," but "y vab ev" (his own son) sounds as "B."

- **C**:
  - Only used followed by "H."
  - "K" is used for the normal 'hard C' sound.

- **CH**: 
  - Sounds as in English, e.g., "chayn" (chain).

- **DH**:
  - Typically sounds like "TH" in English, as in "this" (not as in "thin").
  - At the end of a word, it sounds like "TH" in "thin" unless followed without a pause by a word beginning with a vowel, where it then sounds as "TH" in "this." For example, "pub dydh" (each day) sounds as "DH" as in "thin," but "pub dydh oll" (every day) sounds as "DH" as in "this."

- **E**:
  - When followed by a doubled consonant or in an unstressed syllable, it sounds like "bet," e.g., "penn" (head), "tiek" (farmer).
  - When followed by a single consonant or stressed, it has the same sound but lengthened, similar to French "tête" or "frêne." This is not the same as the vowel sound in English "made" or the French "E acute." For example, "den" (man).

- **EU**: 
  - Sounds like "purr" in English or more accurately as in French "peur," e.g., "beudhi" (to drown).

- **EW**: 
  - Approximately as in English "cow" or more accurately as in Welsh "tew." Try to combine the sound of "E" in "bet" followed immediately by the vowel sound in "boot." This sound may be easier for Cornish speakers.

- **EY**: 
  - Sounds like "veil" in English, e.g., "bleydh" (wolf).

- **G**: 
  - Usually as in English "get" (never as in "giant").
  - At the end of a word, it sounds like English "K" unless followed immediately without a pause by a word beginning with a vowel. For example, "teg" (beautiful) sounds as "K," but "teg a wel" (beautiful to behold/how beautiful!) sounds as "G."

- **GH**: 
  - Sounds like the "CH" in Scottish "loch" or German "achtung." It requires a heavy, unnatural effort for English speakers as it often comes in the middle or at the end of words, unlike English "H." For example, "yeghes" (health).

- **I**: 
  - Sounds like "EE" in "beet," e.g., "gwir" (true).

- **IW**: 
  - A fairly accurate pronunciation can be obtained by saying "seaweed" and then omitting the "-eed," leaving the sound of "ea" followed by "w" as pronounced in English. In practice, there's little distinction between this and "YW."

- **K**: 
  - Typically as in English but as "C" at the end of a word if followed by a vowel.

- **O**: 
  - Normally as the vowel sound in "bought."
  - Sounds like "pot" when followed by a doubled consonant, e.g., "lost" (tail).

- **OE**: 
  - Approximately as in "toe" but without the diphthong that tends to occur in English.
  - More accurately as in French "eau," e.g., "boes" (food). It can also sound like the English "U" in a few words where it's followed by a doubled consonant, e.g., "toemm" (hot).

- **OU**: 
  - Sounds like "oo" in "boot," e.g., "gour" (husband).

- **OW**: 
  - Sounds like "grow," not as in "cow."

- **Q**: 
  - Not used, replaced by "KW."

- **R**: 
  - Always be sounded, i.e., rolled in words like "kar" (friend).

- **U**: 
  - Usually pronounced as in French "tu." It's a cross between English "ee" and "oo" and can be difficult for English speakers. It's recommended as the correct sound for "u" in Cornish, but many Cornish speakers use "i" or "ee" instead. For example, "tus" (men, people).

- **V**: 
  - Typically as in English, but as "F" at the end of a word unless followed by a vowel in the next word immediately without a pause. For example, "genev" (with me) sounds as "F," but "ev a drig" (he dwells) sounds as "V."

- **W**: 
  - See "EW," "IW," and "YW" for specific cases.
  - Otherwise, sounds like "W" in English.

- **X**: 
  - Not used, replaced by "KS."

- **Y**: 
  - When found at the end of a word or between consonants (not with another vowel), the sound is like "I" in "bit," e.g., "bys" (world).
  - When followed by a vowel, the sound is as in English, e.g., "redya" (to read).

- **YW**: 
  - Very much like "IW" above except that "Y" is short and "I" is long. The sound can be illustrated with the name "Pythywwar," which means "What is on" and is used for Dr. Watson.

- **Z**: 
  - Not in use, although some have suggested it could be introduced.

### Doubled Consonants

Where doubled consonants occur at the close of a stressed syllable, they should be sounded separately and distinctly, similar to the two Cs in "hot tap." In practice, it can be challenging to sound a double "n" or double "m" except by following the Late Cornish practice of sounding the first "n" as "d" or the first "m" as "b." This is acceptable.

Double "th" is written as "tth," and double "gh" as "ggh." A vowel before a doubled consonant is short.

### Unstressed Vowels

In unstressed syllables at the end of words, there is a tendency for vowels to be weakened or pronounced as a neutral vowel, similar to the English word "the" (not "thee"). The texts may also indicate this by making apparently different vowels rhyme together.

### Biblical Names

Most Biblical names beginning with "J" should start with "Y" and be pronounced accordingly in Cornish. This pronunciation is currently used by the Language Board, and names like "Yowann" and "Yesus" appear in KDL courses.


## Lesson 1: Discovering Kernow

## Lesson 2: The Mysteries of Mutations

### Gramasek (Grammar)

In the world of Cornish language, words have a secret way of changing their first letter, depending on the word that comes before them. These magical transformations are known as "mutations." The original, unchanged form of a word, as you would find it in a dictionary, is called the "First State." But in the Cornish language, there are four other states of mutations, numbered ²nd, ³rd, ⁴th, and ⁵th.

Here's a quick guide to these intriguing mutation states:

- **¹st state**: The basic dictionary form.
- **²nd state**: Soft mutation.
- **³rd state**: Aspirate (breathed) mutation.
- **⁴th state**: Hard mutation.
- **⁵th state**: Mixed mutation.

However, you'll mostly hear them referred to by their numbers. To help you decipher these mutations, we provide a table as part of this lesson. In the table, a blank space indicates that no change occurs, while a dash signifies that a letter drops out, and the second letter becomes the initial one.

Here's a helpful tip: K, P, and T do not change to G, B, and D respectively when they follow S or TH at the end of the previous word. They remain unchanged. Similarly, K does not change to the ³rd state (H) when followed by L, N, or R because saying Hl, Hn, and Hr would be quite challenging! You can now understand why some words in the vocabulary have a number after them. This number indicates the mutation state of the following word. For example, "a² gews" shows that "gews" is in the second state. Look at the table to find the first state of this word, which is "kews."

**Exercise 1**: Write down the first state of the word following the numbered word.

1) An² vro.
2) Breten² deg.
3) bro² geltek.
4) Ev a² drig.
5) Ev a² gews.
6) Fatell² dhysk.
7) An² Gernewes (Cornishwoman).
8) Ev a dhe² glass.
9) Prag y⁵ tysk ev?
10) Drefenn y² vos Kernewek.

**Exercise 2**: Here are some more words to practice with. Write down their first state as before.

1) dhe² dre (to town).
2) y² goweth (his friend).
3) ow³ howeth (my friend).
4) dhe² wir (truly).
5) an² venyn (the woman).
6) an² dus (the men).
7) dha² das (your father).
8) ow³ thas (my father).
9) yn⁵ fras (greatly).
10) ow⁴ tos (coming).

To use a dictionary effectively, you must convert a mutated word back to its unmutated, first state form before looking it up. Mutated forms are not shown in dictionaries, so always refer to the table until you become perfectly familiar with all the mutations. Embrace the mystery of Cornish mutations!


## Lesson 3: Embracing the Art of Cornish Indefinite Article

### Gramasek (Grammar)

Let's dive into the world of the indefinite article in Cornish. In English, we use the word "a" in front of a noun, like "a peninsula" or "a Cornishman." However, you'll notice from the passage that the indefinite article is not commonly used in Cornish. In Cornish, "a peninsula" is simply "konna tir," and "a Cornishman" is just "Kernow." (In the old Cornish texts, "unn" was sometimes used to mean "a," but this is not usual in Revived Cornish).

**Exercise 3**: Using the words from exercises 1 and 2, let's translate the following into Cornish. Don't forget that the words must be in the first state.

1) A town.
2) A friend.
3) A woman.
4) A father.
5) A class.

In Cornish, simplicity reigns, and sometimes, less is more!
