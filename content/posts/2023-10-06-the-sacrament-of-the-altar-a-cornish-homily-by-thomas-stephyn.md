Here is a blog post about the Sacrament of the Altar that was added later by another priest, Thomas Stephyn, written in markdown code:

#
The Sacrament of the Altar is a homily on the Eucharist that was written in Cornish by Thomas Stephyn, a Catholic priest and scholar, around 1576. It is attached to the Tregear Homilies, a collection of twelve sermons translated from English into Cornish by John Tregear, another Catholic priest and scholar, around 1560. The Tregear Homilies are the longest surviving prose texts in Cornish and are preserved in a manuscript that is currently held at the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth.

## Who was Thomas Stephyn?

Thomas Stephyn was born around 1530 in St Erth, a parish in west Cornwall. He was educated at Oxford University, where he became a fellow of Exeter College in 1555. He was ordained as a priest in 1558 and returned to Cornwall, where he served as a rector of St Erth from 1561 to 1583. He was also a prebendary of Exeter Cathedral from 1562 to 1583.

Stephyn was a loyal Catholic who resisted the Protestant Reformation that took place under Elizabeth I. He was involved in several plots and conspiracies against the English crown, such as the Ridolfi Plot in 1571 and the Throckmorton Plot in 1583. He was arrested and imprisoned several times for his treasonous activities, but he managed to escape or obtain pardons. He died in exile in France in 1588.

## What is the Sacrament of the Altar?

The Sacrament of the Altar is a homily on the Eucharist, the central rite of the Catholic Church that commemorates the Last Supper of Jesus Christ with his disciples. The homily explains the doctrine and practice of the Eucharist from a Catholic perspective, defending it against the Protestant criticisms and objections. The homily also emphasizes the importance and benefits of receiving the Eucharist frequently and devoutly.

The homily is based on various sources, mainly from John Foxe's Acts and Monuments, also known as Foxe's Book of Martyrs, a Protestant history of Christian persecutions and martyrs. Foxe's book contains accounts of the Oxford Disputations of 1554-1555, where Catholic theologians debated with Protestant reformers on various topics, including the Eucharist. Stephyn selectively quotes and translates from Foxe's book to support his Catholic arguments and to refute his Protestant opponents.

The homily is divided into four parts:

- Part 1: The Institution of the Eucharist by Jesus Christ at the Last Supper
- Part 2: The Real Presence of Christ's Body and Blood in the Eucharist
- Part 3: The Sacrifice of Christ's Body and Blood in the Eucharist
- Part 4: The Reception of Christ's Body and Blood in the Eucharist

## Why is the Sacrament of the Altar important?

The Sacrament of the Altar is important for several reasons:

- It is one of the few examples of religious literature in Cornish and shows how Catholic doctrine and practice were expressed in the language.
- It is one of the earliest attempts to revive and preserve Cornish as a written language in the face of English domination and assimilation.
- It is a valuable source of information about the culture, history and identity of Cornwall in the 16th century.

The Sacrament of the Altar has been edited and published several times since its discovery in the 19th century. The most recent edition is by D.H. Frost (2007), who also provides an English translation and a comprehensive commentary. The homily has also been translated back into Cornish by Julyan Holmes (2001) using a modern orthography.

The Sacrament of the Altar is a testament to Thomas Stephyn's passion and dedication for his faith and his language. It is a remarkable achievement that deserves to be recognized and appreciated by anyone interested in Cornish literature and history.
