# The Small Doorway, The Eye of the Needle, and Embracing a Simpler Life

## Introduction

Hidden within the ancient walls of St. Ia's Church lies a small, bricked-up doorway, a silent witness to centuries of history. This unassuming entrance, reminiscent of the concept of the "eye of the needle," carries profound lessons that can inspire us to lead more meaningful lives in the modern world. In this blog, we'll delve into the symbolism of the doorway, explore the idea of the "eye of the needle," and consider how embracing simplicity can enrich our lives today.

## The Small Doorway's Historical Significance

The small doorway, located on the south side of the Trenwith Aisle, was once a private entrance, likely used by the Trenwith family during their visits to the church. Its historical significance lies in its exclusivity, serving as a portal for a select few. But what does it teach us about life and living?

## The Eye of the Needle

In religious and philosophical teachings, the "eye of the needle" often symbolizes a narrow and challenging path to spiritual enlightenment or simplicity. Just as it is said to be easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven, the small doorway reminds us of the importance of shedding excess baggage in our lives.

## Lessons for Today

- **Embrace Simplicity**: Our modern world is filled with distractions, materialism, and the pursuit of wealth and success. The small doorway encourages us to simplify our lives, letting go of unnecessary burdens and focusing on what truly matters.

- **Prioritize Values**: Much like the "eye of the needle" represents a passage to deeper values, we can prioritize love, kindness, and personal growth over the pursuit of material wealth. These enduring values enrich our lives in profound ways.

- **Mindful Living**: The doorway invites us to practice mindfulness, to be fully present in each moment, and to appreciate the beauty of life as it unfolds.

- **Inclusivity**: While the doorway may have once symbolized exclusivity, we can reinterpret it as a reminder of inclusivity. Just as everyone, regardless of their wealth, can pass through the "eye of the needle," we can create a world that welcomes and embraces all.

## Conclusion

The small, bricked-up doorway at St. Ia's Church serves as a powerful symbol of simplicity, mindfulness, and the pursuit of values over material wealth. In a world that often values excess and extravagance, we can draw inspiration from this unassuming entrance to lead more fulfilling lives. By shedding the unnecessary and focusing on what truly matters, we can pass through our own "eye of the needle" and find greater meaning and contentment in the journey.
